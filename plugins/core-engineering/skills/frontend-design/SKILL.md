# Frontend Design Skill

Create **distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces** that avoid generic aesthetics.

## Core Philosophy

**The critical guideline:** Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Design Thinking Process

1. **Understand purpose** - What is this interface trying to achieve?
2. **Select an extreme tone** - Commit to a bold aesthetic direction
3. **Identify one memorable differentiator** - What makes this unique?

## Aesthetic Directions

| Direction | Characteristics |
|-----------|----------------|
| Brutalist | Raw, exposed structure, minimal decoration |
| Maximalist | Rich, layered, abundant visual elements |
| Retro-Futuristic | Nostalgic tech, neon, CRT aesthetics |
| Refined Minimal | Precise spacing, luxury restraint |
| Organic | Natural shapes, flowing layouts |
| Industrial | Grid-heavy, mechanical precision |

## Focus Areas

### Typography
- Choose distinctive, characterful fonts
- Avoid generic system fonts for primary text
- Create clear hierarchy through size and weight
- Consider custom font pairing

### Color & Theme
- Build cohesive palettes with dominant colors
- Use sharp accents for interactive elements
- Commit to the palette consistently
- Consider light/dark mode as design opportunity

### Motion
- Design high-impact animations
- Use staggered page-load reveals
- Make interactions feel responsive
- Keep animations purposeful, not decorative

### Spatial Composition
- Embrace asymmetry when appropriate
- Use overlap and layering creatively
- Break out of predictable grid layouts
- Create visual tension and interest

### Visual Details
- Add atmosphere through gradients
- Use textures with intention
- Apply contextual effects (blur, glow, shadow)
- Polish micro-interactions

## What to Avoid

**Generic AI Aesthetics:**
- Inter/SF Pro as the only fonts
- Purple-to-blue gradients everywhere
- Card-based layouts with rounded corners
- Predictable hero → features → footer structure
- Stock photography or generic illustrations

**Cookie-Cutter Patterns:**
- Bootstrap/Tailwind defaults without customization
- Copy-paste component libraries
- "Safe" color choices
- Boring, expected layouts

## Implementation Matching

Match code complexity to aesthetic vision:

| Aesthetic | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Maximalist | Elaborate animations, layered components |
| Refined Minimal | Restraint, precision, perfect spacing |
| Brutalist | Raw HTML, minimal CSS, intentional roughness |
| Organic | Custom shapes, SVG animations, fluid motion |
